/* vaporware/src/system.c — Clock, TIM3 timebase, TIM1 wall clock for N32G031
 *
 * SysTick is NOT used — unimplemented on the N32G031K8Q7-1 used in the
 * Raz DC25000.  Writes to SYST_CSR are silently discarded and the counter
 * never increments.  TIM3 and TIM1 are used for all timing instead.
 *
 * TIM3 (APB1, base=0x40000400, TIM3EN=APB1ENR bit 1):
 *   PSC=7  → 8 MHz HSI / (7+1) = 1 MHz tick
 *   ARR=999 → UIF (update interrupt flag) fires every 1000 ticks = 1 ms
 *   Polled in delay_ms(); IWDG is fed each 1 ms tick.
 *   Not used for PWM or backlight — PB4 backlight is plain GPIO (active-LOW).
 *
 * TIM1 (APB2, base=0x40012C00, TIM1EN=APB2ENR bit 11):
 *   Free-running 16-bit counter at 1 kHz (wraps every 65535 ms ≈ 65 s).
 *   PSC=7999 → 8 MHz / 8000 = 1 kHz; ARR=0xFFFF (full 16-bit range).
 *   Read with ms_now() for non-blocking elapsed-time checks.
 *   Not used for interrupts, PWM, or capture.
 *   Callers must use (uint16_t) subtraction for safe delta comparisons.
