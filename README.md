# Vaporware

A minimal C firmware SDK for building games and apps on the **Raz DC25000** disposable vape — repurposed as a pocket game console.

The device runs a Nations Tech **N32G031K8Q7-1** (ARM Cortex-M0) driving a 128×160 GC9107 IPS display, with a single button, battery ADC, and a coil MOSFET you can optionally fire. Total cost: ~$15. Total fun: outsized.

>
> - **You assume all risk.** Modifying consumer electronics — especially lithium battery-powered devices — carries real hazards including fire, explosion, electric shock, and permanent hardware damage. Proceed only if you understand what you are doing.
> - **The coil is dangerous.** The heating coil draws significant current from the LiPo cell. Custom firmware that fires the coil incorrectly (wrong duty cycle, no thermal cutoff, wrong timing) can cause the battery to overheat, vent, or catch fire. The examples in this repo do **not** fire the coil. If you choose to, you do so entirely at your own risk.

## Prerequisites

### Hardware

| Item | Notes |
|---|---|
| [ST-Link V2](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=st-link+v2) | SWD programmer (~$8) — keep plugged in for streaming too |
| Raz DC25000 vape | Or any device with an N32G031 + GC9107 |

### Software

**1 — Arm GNU Toolchain 14.2** (cross-compiler)

Download from [developer.arm.com](https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/arm-gnu-toolchain-downloads).
Install to the default path or update the `GCC` / `OBJCOPY` / `SIZE` lines at the top of each `build_*.bat`:
```
C:\Program Files (x86)\Arm GNU Toolchain arm-none-eabi\14.2 rel1\bin\
```

**2 — WSL 2** (Windows Subsystem for Linux)

```powershell
wsl --install          # installs Ubuntu by default — reboot if prompted
```

**3 — OpenOCD in WSL** (flash and SWD debug server)

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install openocd
```

**4 — usbipd-win** (share ST-Link USB with WSL)

Download the installer from [github.com/dorssel/usbipd-win/releases](https://github.com/dorssel/usbipd-win/releases).

After installing, find your ST-Link bus ID (run in PowerShell with ST-Link plugged in):
```powershell
usbipd list
```
Look for a line like `1-2   0483:3748  STMicroelectronics ST-Link`. The `build_*.bat` and `flash_vape.bat` scripts hardcode `--busid 1-2` — if yours differs, edit that line in the batch file.

**5 — Python 3 + pip packages** (for host-side tools and streamer)

```cmd
pip install pillow mss numpy pywin32
```

| Package | Required for |
|---|---|
| `pillow` | All streaming modes (screen, window, video) |
| `mss` | Fast screen-region capture (`--screen`) |
| `numpy` | 10× faster BGR565 conversion (optional but recommended) |
| `pywin32` | Window capture by title (`--window`) |

---

## Quick Start

### 1 — Wire the ST-Link

| ST-Link pin | Vape test pad |
|---|---|
| SWDIO | PA13 |
| SWCLK | PA14 |
| GND | GND |
| 3.3 V | — (vape is self-powered, leave disconnected) |

### 2 — Build

Open a Command Prompt, go to the example you want, and run the build script:

```cmd
cd examples\flappy
build_flappy.bat
```

Output lands in `examples\flappy\build\flappy.bin`.

### 3 — Flash

```cmd
python gen_direct_flash.py   :: generates direct_flash.tcl from the .bin
flash_vape.bat               :: attaches ST-Link to WSL, runs OpenOCD
```

The vape boots into the new firmware immediately after flashing.

## Examples

| Example | Description | Key features used |
|---|---|---|
| **flappy** | Flappy Bird clone | display, button, battery meter |
| **slots** | One-armed bandit with persistent high score | display, button, nv storage |
| **diagnostic** | Hardware probe — dumps all sensor readings to display | all modules |
| **template** | Skeleton app — copy this to start a new project | app framework |
| **streamer** | Stream live video from PC to the display via SWD (~7 fps) | display, SWD protocol, Python host |

The streamer example does not use the `app` framework — it implements its own `main()` and loops on an SWD-driven protocol. The companion host script (`stream_frames.py`) captures any window or screen region and pushes frames over ST-Link. See [`examples/streamer/README.md`](examples/streamer/README.md) for full setup and usage.

---

## Library Overview

The `src/` library provides everything needed to run apps. You never call `main()` — the framework does that. Just implement two functions:

```c
void app_init(void) {
    // called once at startup — set up your initial state and draw first frame
    display_fill(COL_BLACK);
}

void app_update(uint32_t frame) {
    // called ~30 times per second — update state, redraw changed regions
    if (button_just_pressed()) { /* ... */ }
}
```

| Module | What it does |
|---|---|
| `system` | 8 MHz HSI clock, TIM3 delay, TIM1 wall clock, IWDG feed |
| `display` | GC9107 init, fill, set window, draw pixel, draw image (RGB565) |
| `button` | PA7 debounce — pressed / just_pressed / just_released / held_ms |
| `battery` | PB0 ADC read, raw-to-voltage conversion, charge-level thresholds |
| `nv` | Write-forward NV storage in top 4 KB of flash — read / write / reset |
| `vape` | Coil safety init — holds PB0 LOW at reset to prevent accidental fire |
| `app` | `main()`, frame timer, sleep timeout, hold-to-reset, hardware init order |

Full API documentation: [`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md)

## Creating a New App

1. Copy `examples/template/` and rename the folder
2. Rename `build_template.bat` → `build_<yourapp>.bat` and set `APP_NAME`
3. Edit `src/main.c` — implement `app_init()` and `app_update()`
4. Build and flash using the same workflow as the examples above

The template build script already references `../../src` for the library — no path changes needed as long as your app lives under `examples/`.

---

## Flashing Tools

`tools/` contains host-side Python scripts for tasks beyond the normal build/flash flow:

| Script | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `flash_charge.py` | Flash any `.bin` via OpenOCD telnet (edit `BIN_PATH` at top) |
| `check_voltage.py` | Read live battery voltage via SWD without flashing |
| `diag_display.py` | Drive display init and fill sequences manually via OpenOCD |
| `cam_capture.py` | Capture a frame from a USB webcam (display debugging) |
| `spi_sniff.py` | Passive SPI transaction capture via SWD memory reads |

All scripts connect to an already-running OpenOCD telnet server on port 6666.

## Reverse Engineering Notes

The original Raz DC25000 firmware was reverse-engineered using Ghidra.
Findings (pin assignments, function addresses, display init sequence, flash memory map)
are documented in [`docs/FINDINGS.md`](docs/FINDINGS.md).
Raw firmware dumps and analysis scripts live in [`docs/reverse_engineering/`](docs/reverse_engineering/).
